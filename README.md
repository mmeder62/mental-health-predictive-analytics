# Crisis Intervention: Predictive Modeling for Suicide Prevention

### A Sociological Lens on Mental Health
With 37 years of experience in sociology, I developed this project to demonstrate how predictive analytics can be used for early crisis intervention. This model focuses on Philadelphia’s demographic vulnerabilities.

## The Model
I used **Logistic Regression** to estimate the probability of high-risk mental health crises based on social determinants:
- **Marital Disruption:** (Divorce/Widowhood)
- **Economic Instability:** (Unemployment)
- **Social Isolation:** (Living Alone)

## Key Technical Insight
Unlike simple correlations, this model calculates **Odds Ratios**. For instance, the model identifies the "Multiplier Effect" when unemployment and divorce occur simultaneously.
