# Technical Justification: Logistic Regression

### Why Logistic Regression?
Since the outcome (Risk) is binary (High vs. Low), OLS regression would be inappropriate. Logistic regression provides the **Probability** of an event, which is actionable for healthcare providers.

### Feature Selection
Variables like 'Divorce' and 'Unemployment' were selected based on sociological literature (Durkheimian theory) and Philadelphia-specific social trends.
